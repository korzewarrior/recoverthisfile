# RecoverThisFile.com

A satirical/parody website that serves as the perfect competitor to DeleteThisFile.com. While DeleteThisFile offers "secure file deletion" with exaggerated claims, RecoverThisFile counters with equally exaggerated claims about file recovery and "digital resurrection."

## Project Overview

This project creates a complete parody website with similar structure, gamification, and aesthetic as DeleteThisFile.com, but flipped to the opposite purpose - file recovery instead of deletion.

### Key Features

- **Satirical Technical Claims**: Includes fictional technologies like "Quantum Reconstruction," "Molecular Data Mapping," and "Time-Reversed Entropy" with exaggerated success rates
- **Interactive UI**: Drag-and-drop interface, progress animations, and achievement system
- **Gamification**: Points, achievements, and rewards for file recovery
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with dark/light theme toggle
- **Mirrored Structure**: Same page organization as DeleteThisFile.com but with recovery-focused content

## File Structure

```
recoverthisfile/
├── css/
│   └── styles.css        # Main stylesheet with blue/green recovery theme
├── js/
│   ├── script.js         # Main JavaScript with recovery simulation
│   ├── theme.js          # Dark/light mode toggle functionality
│   └── footer.js         # Footer component injection
├── index.html            # Main recovery page with drag-drop interface
├── how-it-works.html     # Page explaining fictional recovery technology
└── README.md             # This documentation file
```

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- No server-side code required (all processing is simulated client-side)
- LocalStorage used to persist achievement/point data
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Running the Project

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and interact with the site.

## Purpose

This website was created as a humorous counterpoint to DeleteThisFile.com, demonstrating that the exaggerated claims of "permanent deletion" can be matched with equally exaggerated claims of "miraculous recovery." It serves as a satirical commentary on how technical jargon and overblown marketing claims can make anything sound feasible in the tech world.

## Legal Note

This is a parody/satire project created for educational and entertainment purposes. All technologies mentioned are fictional, and no actual file recovery is performed. The site does not actually collect, transmit, or recover any user data.
